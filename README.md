1. INTRODUCTION

Machine Learning model allows us to build models to get quickly cleaned and processed data 

and deliver results faster. By using this system doctors will make good decisions related to 

patient diagnoses and according to that, good treatment will be given to the patient, which 

increases improvement in patient healthcare services. [10]

To introduce machine learning in the medical field, healthcare is the prime example. To improve 

the accuracy of large data, the existing work will be done on unstructured or textual data. 

For the prediction of diseases, the existing will be done on linear, KNN, 

Decision Tree algorithm. Machine Learning is the domain that uses past data for predicting. 

Machine Learning is the understanding of computer system under which the Machine 

Learning model learn from data and experience. 

The machine learning algorithm has two phases: 1) Training & 2) Testing. 

To predict the disease from a patient’s symptoms and from the history of the patient, machine 

learning technology is struggling from past decades. [9]

Healthcare issues can be solved efficiently by using Machine Learning Technology. We are 

applying complete machine learning concepts to keep the track of patient’s health. ML model 

allows us to build models to get quickly cleaned and processed data and deliver results faster.

By using this system doctors will make good decisions related to patient diagnoses and 

according to that, good treatment will be given to the patient, which increases improvement 

in patient healthcare services. 

To introduce machine learning in the medical field, healthcare is the prime example. To 

improve the accuracy of large data, the existing work will be done on unstructured or textual 

data. For the prediction of diseases, the existing will be done on linear, KNN, Decision Tree 

algorithm.

Due to an increased amount of data growth in the medical and healthcare field the accurate 

analysis on medical data which has been benefited from early patient care.

With the help of disease data, data mining finds hidden pattern information in the huge medical 

data of the data set. [1]

We proposed a disease prediction platform, based on the vitals of the patient. Our disease 

prediction ML model predicts the occurrence of kidney diseases. 

Here are some examples of how useful ML can be in field of medicine -

• Spotting diseases: Machine learning can look at X-rays and scans to help find problems

early.

• Medicine magic: It can help design new drugs and figure out which ones might work

best or you.

• Personalized care: Like a super-smart assistant, it can suggest the best treatment plan

based on your health.

• Predicting health bumps: Machine learning can warn doctors if you might get sick, so

they can help prevent it.

Machine learning is not meant to replace doctors; rather, it serves as a powerful assistant, 

augmenting their expertise with data-driven insights and capabilities. [2]

This collaboration between human intelligence and machine learning holds immense 

promise for the future of healthcare. 

By leveraging machine learning's ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify 

complex patterns, doctors can gain a deeper understanding of their patients' conditions and 

make more informed treatment decisions. [2]

Machine learning can also automate routine tasks, freeing up doctors' time to focus on what 

they do best: building relationships with patients and providing compassionate care. [6]

Ultimately, this synergistic approach between human and machine intelligence has the 

potential to revolutionize healthcare, making it faster, more precise, and ultimately, more 

effective. [1]

Along with it, we have also provided an about page which gives information about the 

symptoms & information about the diseases.


3. OBJECTIVES

The objectives of our project are as follows: -

1. Early detection & treatment: - Engineers and medical researchers are 

trying to develop machine learning algorithms and models that can identify 

chronic kidney disease at an early stage. The problem is that the data 

generated in the health industry is large and complex, making data analysis 

difficult. [7]

2. Reducing the fatality of disease: - Combination of estimated glomerular 

filtration rate (GFR), age, diet, existing medical conditions, and albuminuria 

can be used to assess the severity of kidney disease, but requires more 

accurate information about the risk to the kidney is required to make clinical 

decisions. [3]

3. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a life-threatening condition that can be 

difficult to diagnose early because there are no symptoms. The purpose of 

the proposed study is to develop and validate a predictive model for the 

prediction of chronic kidney disease.

The main function of the kidney is to filter the blood in the body. Kidney 

disease is a silent killer because it can cause kidney failure without causing 

any symptoms or concern. [4]

4. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a decline in kidney function over a 

period of months or years. Kidney disease is often caused by diabetes and 

high blood pressure, and by using models such as these we would be able to 

predict, detect, prevent as well as properly cure such diseases.
